Chapter 8: Bootstrapping, Glaciers, and Directional Data
=======================

We will use bootstrap resampling to esimate the average (glacial and wind flow) directions and also estimate confidence intervals, without making assumptions about the distribution the samples are pulled from.

* Bootstrap resampling
* Evidence of past glaciation and visualizing directional data
