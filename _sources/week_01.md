## EPS 88 Fall 2020

[![Welcome to EPS 88 Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6-K3slGttf8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-K3slGttf8 "")

This semester EPS 88 will be slightly different from past iterations. Instruction will be completely remote and almost all asynchronous. We have several tools to facilitate this:

- The bCourses site. This will be your home base where you will find the syllabus, important links, announcements, and reading quizzes. There will be a Module for each week of the semester where you can find the pre-class, during-class, and after-class work.
- The course digital textbook. This is where you will find the pre-class reading and video assignments. You are Here!
- The course OK site. This is where you will submit your Jupyter Notebook assignments.

Each week's module workflow will consist of:
* mix-media reading and video content the student will read and watch before the class meeting
* a low-stacks concept check quiz covering the material from the reading/video assignments
* a Jupyter notebook we will work through together during the weekly class zoom meeting (Tuesdays noon-2pm)
* a Jupyter notebook homework\* assignment (\* yes, all the work is homework)

We'll schedule a weekly "office-hour" zoom opportunity to for students to ask questions, but please, post your questions to the bCourse discussion pages. We will answer questions there for the benefit of everyone.
