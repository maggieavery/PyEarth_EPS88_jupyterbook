Chapter 11: Classification
=======================

We'll use the machine learning technique, classification, to make predictions in a _test_ dataset after teaching the algorithm the patterns in our _training_ dataset. There are **many** applications of classification in Earth Science. We'll explore a few geologic and land-use examples.

* Classification
* Structural geology - folds
* Land use - anthropogeomorphology
* Basaltic sources
