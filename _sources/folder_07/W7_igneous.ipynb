    "Another scheme for classifying igneous rocks is by their geochemistry i.e. by the chemical composition of the minerals that form them. The end-members of this spectrum are _feslic_ and _mafic_ compositions. This illustration provides an overview of the compositional difference between different types of igneous rocks:\n",
