    "In 1920, Milutin Milankovitz  explained the coming and going of ice ages as a response to changes in the Earth's _insolation_ (the amount of energy recieved from the sun). He argued that insolation is controlled by changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun.  This idea has now been widely embraced by the paleoclimate community, largely because of the very strong coherence between cycles in Earth's orbit and evidence for changes in ice volume using geochemical proxies like oxygen isotopes —— data we will look at today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The orbital cycles are influenced by gravity of the Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn and can be calculated knowing their orbital parameters.  Milankovitch famously took the first stab at it from his prison cell during WWI. Nowadays it is calculated with supercomputers.  The key parameters are _eccentricity_ (or ovalness of the orbit around the sun), the _obliquity_ (tilt) of the spin axis and the _precession_ of the spin axis.  \n",
