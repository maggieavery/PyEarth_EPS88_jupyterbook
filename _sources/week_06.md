Chapter 6: Probability Distributions and Random Earth Processes
=======================

This week we will be considering physical processes which can be modeled as random events controlled by some _probability distribution_.

In this reading assignment you will build background knowledge about random sampling and Poisson processes. A _Poisson_ probability distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time. The events occur independently and with a constant average rate. The occurrence of an event does not depend on the time since the last event.
