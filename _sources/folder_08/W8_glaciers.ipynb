    "Around 20,000 years ago was the last glacial maximum, the most recent of glacial intervals associated with climate going between a glacial and interglacial climate states over the past 2.5 million years. We will look at data associated with more of these cycles when we talk about time-series analysis. For the moment, let's focus on the warming from the last glacial maximum which is visualized (based on estimates published in a couple different scientific papers) in the following xkcd comic:\n",

    "\n",
    "> The Cordilleran ice sheet most recently advanced out of the mountains of British Columbia about 25,000 14C yr B.P. It flowed west onto the continental shelf, east into the intermontaine valleys of British Columbia where it probably merged with the western edge of the Laurentide ice sheet, and south into the lowlands of Washington State (Fig. 8, Table 1). In southern British Columbia and western Washington the Puget lobe filled the Fraser Lowland and the Puget Lowland between the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Range. The Juan de Fuca lobe extended east along the Strait of Juan de Fuca to termine some 100km west of Washington’s present coast. Several ice lobes east of the Cascade Range expanded south down the Okanogan Valley and down other valleys farther east. The Fraser-age ice-sheet maximum on both sides of the Cascade Range was broadly synchronous (Waitt & Thorson, 1983). It approximately coincided with the maximum advance of some parts of the Laurentide ice sheet in central North America at about 14,000 14C yr B.P. but lagged several thousand years behind the culminating advance of the most of the Laurentide ice sheet (Lowell et al., 1999; Mickelson et al., 1983; Prest, 1969). *The cordilleran ice sheet, Booth et al. 2003\n",

    "- As we have done with earlier maps we set the edges of our map with ```ax.set_extent([])``` and add coastlines and a background image if wanted with ```ax.add_image()``` and ```ax.coastlines()```.\n",
    "- We will use ```plt.quiver()``` to add the data to the map. The data needs to be input as numpy arrays. First the positions of the arrows are given with the longitude and latitude arrays. Then the arrow properties are input - their x-component lengths and y-component lengths. Then as with other map plots we need to set ```transform=ccrs.PlateCarree()```. The color and scale of the arrows can be set to make a nice looking map.\n",

    "As Earth scientists, we like to make plots that convey the most information with the least amount of effort for the viewer.  2D directional data are much better represented as 'rose diagrams', which are really just histograms plotted around a circle. They are also known as _polar_ projections as they could be used to make a map of the Earth looking down at one of the poles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow these steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- For rose diagrams, we will create a  plot instance (called ```fig```) with the ```plt.subplot( )``` function.  We make it a _polar_ plot by setting the ```polar``` keyword to ```True```. \n",
    "- The _polar_ type of subplot has funny coordinates set as default, funny to an Earth scientist at least.  The orientations go around counterclockwise instead of clockwise (like map directions). To make it seem more normal for Earth science data,  we have to switch around the directions to geographic coordinates.  We do this with the **fig.set_theta_direction(-1)** function where the '-1' tells **matplotlib** that we want the numbers to go around clockwise, instead of the default (which for some unknown reason goes counter clockwise).  \n",
    "- We also have to put '0' at the top of the diagram (because it is 'North' in Earth science).  We do that with the ```fig.set_theta_zero_location('N')``` call, which tells ```matplotlib``` to put 0 on top (instead of on the right side which is the default).  \n",
    "-  We have to define some bins, sort of like histograms but around azimuthal circle, and count up how many directions are in each bin.  We will use a bin size of 10$^{\\circ}$.  Fortunately, ```plt.hist( )``` will count up the number of directional data in each bin for us! Usually we just use ```plt.hist()``` to make the plot, but we can also have it return the bins and the number in each bin.\n",
    "- We will use the  plot function **plt.bar( )** which normally makes bar charts, but will make rose diagrams if the plot is _polar_.\n",
    "- Finally, we will plot the data on the figure instance. \n",
