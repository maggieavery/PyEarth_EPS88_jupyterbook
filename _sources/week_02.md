Chapter Two: Dynamic Earth and Data Input
=======================

This week we will focus on building some background earth science knowledge:

* Data input and output i.e. loading and saving
* Thinking in *geologic time* and evidence that Earth is an ever-changing planet
* The structure of Earth
* Types of rocks and the rock cycle
* The process that drives Earth's dynamics: *plate tectonics*
