Chapter 9: Regression and Atmospheric CO$_{2}$ Concentration
=======================

We will use a least squares method to fit a line to data and a local weighted regression method to fit curved models. These methods will be used to explore trends and variations in the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere with time.

* Regression of bivarient data
* Variations of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere with time
