## EPS 88 Fall 2020

This semester EPS 88 will be slightly different from past iterations. Instruction will be completely remote and almost all asynchronous. We have several tools to facilitate this:

- The bCourses site. This will be your home base where you will find the syllabus, important links, announcements, and reading quizzes. There will be a Module for each week of the semester where you can find the pre-class, during-class, and after-class work.
- The course digital textbook. This is where you will find the pre-class reading and video assignments. You are Here!
- The course OK site. This is where you will submit your Jupyter Notebook assignments.

Each week's module workflow will consist of:
* mix-media reading and video content the student will read and watch before the class meeting
* a low-stacks concept check quiz covering the material from the reading/video assignments
* a Jupyter notebook we will work through together during the weekly class zoom meeting (Tuesdays noon-2pm)
* a Jupyter notebook homework\* assignment (\* yes, all the work is homework)

We'll schedule a weekly "office-hour" zoom opportunity to for students to ask questions, but please, post your questions to the class discourse discussion pages. We will answer questions there for the benefit of everyone.
