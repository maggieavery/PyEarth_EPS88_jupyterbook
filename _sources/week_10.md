Chapter 10: Time Series Analysis and Glacial Cycles
=======================
We will use spectral analysis to study the dominant frequencies of variations in ice-core CO$_2$ and marine sediment-core oxygen isotopes, which are both paleoclimate indicators, to study the drivers of glacial-interglacial cycles.

* Time series spectral analysis
* Glacial-interglacial cycle timescales
